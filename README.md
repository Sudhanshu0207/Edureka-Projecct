#StockExchange house is a mid-sized company that manages the investment of its
clients. Its clients have exposure to various types of instruments such as Mutual

The nature of the stock business is highly volatile; hence the company needs to send
report of the stock prices to its customers many times in a day. The company is
planning to create an automation process that will fetch stock prices from
https://www.nasdaq.com/market-activity/stocks website and send the report to its
customers.
